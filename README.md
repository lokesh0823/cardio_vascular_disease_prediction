# 🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on patient health data. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## 📌 Objective

To build a machine learning model that can accurately classify whether a person is at risk of cardiovascular disease using clinical and behavioral attributes.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
- Scikit-learn – Machine learning models, evaluation metrics, GridSearchCV

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers
2. **Feature Engineering**: Scaled features, converted categorical variables
3. **Modeling**: Used `RandomForestClassifier` for classification
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Applied `GridSearchCV` to optimize performance
5. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
